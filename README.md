# Dog or Cat

[Play with the App](https://dogorcat.herokuapp.com/)

A simple Flask App that can classify an image as Dog or Cat
using a convolutional neural network model. I build this just
because i wanted to get out of the jupyter notebook and
deploy a Deep learning model and have something i can send
to friends so they can upload their images of their face and let my app
insult them.

 ## Image Classification:
 Image classification refer to the task of extracting information classes from a multiband raster Image.
 Depending on the interaction between the analyst and the computer during the classification, there two type of classification : supervised and unsupervised
 we will working with supervised image classification
 
## Tools Used:
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* h5py
* Flask
* Bootstrap
* Heroku
