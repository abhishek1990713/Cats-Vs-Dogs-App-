# Dog or Cat

[Play with the App](https://dogorcat.herokuapp.com/)

A simple Flask App that can classify an image as Dog or Cat
using a convolutional neural network model. I build this just
because i wanted to get out of the jupyter notebook and
deploy a Deep learning model and have something i can send
to friends so they can upload their images of their face and let my app
insult them.

 Image Classification
 Image classification refer to the task of extracting information classes from a multiband raster Image.
 Depending on the interaction between the analyst and the computer during the classification, there two type of classification : supervised and unsupervised
 we will working with supervised image classification
